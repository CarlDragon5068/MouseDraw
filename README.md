# MouseDraw

INSTALLATION:

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/CarlDragon5068/MouseDraw
cd MouseDraw
```

INSTALL REQUIREMENTS:

```
pip install autogui numpy pillow
```

USAGE:

Put the local path of the image you want to recreate in source_image variable in the form of a png or jpg file. You can modify pixel_size and drawing_speed in the function main().

HOW IT WORKS:

This program takes any coloured image and converts it to black and white by converting all pixels with values less than 128 to white and above 128 to black. Then the program would draw the image using the mouse, line by line, on a paint software.
